## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
```

```{r}
df_anomaly = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\anomaly_2000_2010.csv")
df_ch4 = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\ch4_2000_2010.csv")
df_co2 = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\co2_2000_2010.csv")
```


```{r}
# Convert to monthly time series starting Jan 2000
ch4_ts = ts(df_ch4$average, 
             start = c(2000, 1), 
             frequency = 12)
```

```{r}
 # Perform additive decomposition
 ch4_decomposed = decompose(ch4_ts, type = "additive")
 
 # Plot components
 plot(ch4_decomposed)
```

From the decomposition plot:
- The time series exhibits a clear increasing trend over time.
- There is a strong seasonal pattern, meaning that certain fluctuations repeat at regular intervals.
- The random component contains some nouse but does not dominate the overall structure.

```{r}
# Extract components
components = data.frame(
   Date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2000-01-01"), 
                   by = "month", 
                   length.out = length(ch4_ts)),
   Observed = ch4_decomposed$x,
   Trend = ch4_decomposed$trend,
   Seasonal = ch4_decomposed$seasonal,
   Random = ch4_decomposed$random
 )
 
 # Plot observed vs decomposed trend
 ggplot(components, aes(x = Date)) +
   geom_line(aes(y = Observed, color = "Observed")) +
   geom_line(aes(y = Trend, color = "Decomposed Trend"), na.rm = TRUE) +
   labs(title = "CH4 Levels: Observed vs Decomposed Trend",
        y = "CH4 (ppm)",
        color = "Legend") +
   theme_minimal()

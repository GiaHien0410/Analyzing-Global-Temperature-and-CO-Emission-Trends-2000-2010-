# Uncertainties in the global monthly means are estimated using two,,,,,
# terms: The first is a bootstrap (resampling) method that varies the,,,,,
# sites in our network. Each pseudo-network contains the same number of,,,,,
# sites as our actual NOAA ESRL cooperative global air sampling network,,,,,
# but some are repeated and some are excluded. The second term is a,,,,,
# Monte Carlo method that randomly modifies the data to account for,,,,,
# measurement uncertainty. In both cases, 100 globally-averaged time,,,,
# series are created. Standard deviations of the monthly means are,,,,,
# calculated, and the two terms (network and analytical) are taken in,,,,
# quadrature to give the  reported uncertainties. A default value (-9.9),,,,,
# indicates the uncertainty has not yet been calculated for that month.,,,,,
# Please see Dlugokencky et al.,1994,, vol. 99, 17021-17043, for a
# complete discussion.,,,,,

# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also change for the same,,,,
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.,,,,,

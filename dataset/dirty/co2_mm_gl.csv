# The uncertainty in the global monthly mean is estimated using a,,,,,
# a monte carlo technique that computes 200 globally-averaged time,,,,,
# series, each time using a slightly different set of measurement,,,,
# records from the NOAA GML cooperative air sampling network.  The,,,,,
# reported uncertainty is the mean of the standard deviations,,,,,
# for each monthly mean using this technique.  Please see Conway et al.,,,,,
# 1994, JGR,, no. D11. for a complete discussion.  Units are ppm.,,
#,,,,,
# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol,,,,
#,,,,,
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same,,,,

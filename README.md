This study aims to explore the relationship between global temperature anomalies and greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂ and CH₄) over the period 2000-2010. By analyzing monthly trends, we seek to determine whether increases in atmospheric CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations correspond to significant temperature changes. The study will use statistical correlation and trend analysis to assess the strength and direction of these relationships.

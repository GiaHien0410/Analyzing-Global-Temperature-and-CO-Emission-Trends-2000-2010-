## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Objective:
To analyze the relationship between global CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies from 2000 to 2010, identifying potential correlations and trends. The study aims to determine whether rising CO₂ levels correspond to an increase in global temperatures, providing insights into climate change patterns.

Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant correlation between global CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies from 2000 to 2010.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant positive correlation between global CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies from 2000 to 2010, indicating that rising CO₂ levels contribute to temperature increases.
```{r}
df_anomaly = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\anomaly_2000_2010.csv")
df_ch4 = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\ch4_2000_2010.csv")
df_co2 = read.csv("D:\\DS-B3\\Spatial\\Analyzing-Global-Temperature-and-CO-Emission-Trends-2000-2010-\\dataset\\co2_2000_2010.csv")
```

```{r}
head(df_anomaly)
head(df_ch4)
```
```{r}
names(df_ch4)[names(df_ch4) == "average"] = "average_ch4"
names(df_ch4)[names(df_ch4) == "trend"] = "trend_ch4"
```



```{r}
data_ch4 = merge(df_ch4, df_anomaly, by = c("Year", "Month"), all.x = TRUE)
data_ch4 <- data_ch4[order(data_ch4$Year, data_ch4$Month), ]
```

```{r}
data_ch4$Date = as.Date(paste(data_ch4$Year, data_ch4$Month, "01", sep = "-"))
```

```{r}
print(data_ch4, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Plot the time series of the 'average' and 'trend' columns
ggplot(data_ch4, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = average_ch4, color = "Average")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend_ch4, color = "Trend")) +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Average and Trend",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Value",
       color = "Legend") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
# Perform a paired t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(data_ch4$average_ch4, data_ch4$trend_ch4, paired = FALSE)
print(t_test_result)
```
```{r}
# Convert to a time series object
ts_ch4 <- ts(data_ch4$average, frequency = 12, start = c(2000, 1))

# Decompose the time series
decomposed <- decompose(ts_ch4)
plot(decomposed)
```

### ADF Test

```{r}
# Load the 'tseries' library for ADF test
library(tseries)

# Perform ADF test
adf_test_result <- adf.test(data_ch4$average_ch4)
print(adf_test_result)
```

- Dickey-Fuller Test Statistic
  - Test statistic = -3.5241
  - The more negative this value is, the stronger the evidence for stationarity.
- Lag Order = 5
  - This indicates that the test used 5 lagged values in the regression model.
- p-value = 0.04291
  - Since p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H₀) at the 5% significance level, meaning that the time series is likely stationary.
- Conclusion
  - The methane (CH₄) data appears to be stationary, meaning that its mean and variance do not change significantly over time.
  - If the p-value were greater than 0.05, it would suggest non-stationarity, and we might need to apply transformations (e.g., differencing, detrending) to make it stationary before performing time series modeling (e.g., ARIMA).


```{r}
# Create a time index (since Year and Month together represent time progression)
data_ch4$Time_Index <- 1:nrow(df_ch4)
```

### Linear Regression Analysis

```{r}
# Perform Linear Regression (CH4 Trend vs. Time)
linear_model <- lm(trend_ch4 ~ Time_Index, data = data_ch4)
summary(linear_model)  # Check regression results
```

- Formula: trend_ch4 ~ Time_Index
  - This models methane trends (trend_ch4) as a function of time (Time_Index).
- Intercept (1.767e+03 ≈ 1767)
  - This represents the estimated CH₄ level at Time_Index = 0.
- Time_Index Coefficient (2.018e-01 ≈ 0.2018)
  - This means that methane levels increase by approximately 0.2018 units per time step.
  - The t-value = 20.62 and p-value < 2.2e-16, which indicate that the trend is statistically highly significant.
- R-squared = 0.7658 (76.6%)
  - About 76.6% of the variation in methane levels is explained by time, meaning the model fits the data well.
- F-statistic = 425, p-value < 2.2e-16
  - The overall regression model is statistically significant.

### Mann-Kendall Test (Non-Parametric Trend Test)

```{r}
# Perform Mann-Kendall Test (for trend detection)
mk_test <- MannKendall(data_ch4$trend_ch4)
print(mk_test)  # Check if the trend is significant
```

- Tau (τ) = 0.737
  - This represents the strength of the trend. A positive τ value close to 1 suggests a strong increasing trend.
- p-value ≤ 2.22e-16
  - This means the detected trend is highly significant, confirming a strong increasing pattern in methane levels over time.

### Shapiro-Wilk test (null => normally distributed, alternative => not normally distributed)

```{r}
shapiro.test((data_ch4$average_ch4))
```
- Test Statistic (W-value)
  - The W-value = 0.94371.
  - A value closer to 1 suggests a normal distribution, while a lower value suggests deviation from normality.
- p-value
  - p-value = 3.356 × 10⁻⁵ (0.00003356)
  - Since p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H₀), meaning that the data does not follow a normal distribution.

- Conclusion
  - The Shapiro-Wilk test suggests that the CH₄ (methane) data is not normally distributed.
  - If you plan to apply statistical tests that assume normality (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation), you might need to transform the data (log/square root transformation) or use non-parametric tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation).

```{r}
library(car)
leveneTest(trend_ch4 ~ Date, data = data_ch4)  # Tests variance homogeneity
```

### Welch Two Sample t test

```{r}
t_test <- t.test(average_ch4 ~ Year, data = subset(data_ch4, Year %in% c(2000, 2010)))
t_test
```

- Test Statistic (t-value): t-value = -12.344, indicating a large difference between the two groups
- Degrees of Freedom (df): df = 21.826, meaning the test used Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal variances
- p-value = 2.566x10^-11, very small(< 0.05) => reject null hypothesis => statistically significant
- Confidence Interval (95% CI) = (-30.06145, -21.41022). Since 0 is not in the interval, it further supports that there is a significant difference
- Mean CH4 Levels in Each Years: an increase in methane levels over the decade

### ANOVA Model

```{r}
anova_model <- aov(average_ch4 ~ as.factor(Year), data = data_ch4)
summary(anova_model)

```
```{r}
cor.test(data_ch4$average_ch4, data_ch4$Anomaly, method = "pearson")
```

Correlation Between CH₄ & Anomaly

```{r}
cor.test(data_ch4$average_ch4, data_ch4$Anomaly, method = "pearson")  # Linear
cor.test(data_ch4$average_ch4, data_ch4$Anomaly, method = "spearman")  # Rank-based
```

Pearson:
- cor = 0.3485 => moderate positive correlation
- p-value = 4.219x10^-5, very small => correlation is statistically significant
- 95% confidence interval is (0.1889, 0.4909), suggesting the true correlation lies within this range

Spearman's Rank Correlation (Nonlinear, Rank-Based)
- The Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) is 0.3781, also suggesting a moderate positive correlation.
- The p-value is 7.812 × 10⁻⁶, meaning the correlation is statistically significant.
- There is a warning about ties, which means some values in the dataset are repeated, and an exact p-value couldn't be computed, but an approximation was used.

=> Pearson test suggests a linear relationship, while Spearman's test suggests a monotonic relationship, which may handle nonlinear trends better
=> Both tests give similar results, it confirms a statistically significant association between CH4 and Anomaly values.
